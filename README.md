# Checkpoint

## Manual Installation

Copy the checkpoint.sh bash script to your /usr/local/bin folder and name it 'checkpoint':

```bash
cp ./checkpoint /usr/local/bin
```

Add an alias to your .bashrc or .zshrc to make sure that `checkpoint` will always be sourced:

```bash
alias checkpoint="source checkpoint"
```
